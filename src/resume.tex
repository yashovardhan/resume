\quote{I am an experienced JavaScript Developer, an Open Source Enthusiast who mostly develops mobile applications in React Native & Redux. With more than 2000 contributions on GitHub till now, I have quite an experience with development. I am also good with designing and backend implementation a bit, so I can help out in other ways if needed. My interest mostly lies in developing applications that are challenging and are non-conventional to implement. Innovative ideas motivate me furthermore.}
